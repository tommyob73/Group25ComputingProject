         <h2>Project ID Number: 25</h2>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Project Topic: U.S. Leading Causes of Death</h2>
         <p>This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States, beginning in 1999 to 2017. The data is based on information from all resident deaths. This data also analyzes the information at the state level. This is interesting since you can learn the trends of diseases and causes of death and compare state by state and across the U.S. over time. </p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Exploration Questions</h2>
         <p>Here are the main exploration questions that guided our thought process and our visualization creation: <br>
         Question 1: How many deaths were there in each state from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 2: What was the leading cause of death in each state in 2017?  <br />
         Question 3: What was the leading cause of death in the USA as a whole in 2017 (most recent data)?  <br />
         Question 4: How many people died from “accidents” from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 5: What trends exist for cancer deaths from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 6: Are certain states more at risk for certain death causes?  <br />
         Question 7: Is there a certain cause of death in the U.S. that is rising rapidly and needs to be controlled?  <br />
         Question 8: Which states have the least number of deaths relative to population in the state?  <br />
         Question 9: Which state has the highest/lowest number of Alzheimer’s Disease?  <br />
         Question 10: Do states that are more highly populated have a greater percentage of deaths from Influenza?  <br />
         Question 11: What is the average number of people killed by heart disease in New York from 2010 to 2017?  <br />
         Question 12: Which cause of death has the highest age-adjusted death rate in Nevada?  <br />
         Question 13: When factoring in population, which states have the highest and lowest death rates per capita?  <br />
         Question 14: What are the underlying factors that cause certain states to have higher death rates per capita, such as age demographics, healthcare spending, and inactivity presences?  <br />
         Question 15: Is there a correlation between these underlying factors and the death rates across states?  <br />

         <h2>Data Sources</h2>
         <p>The data source is a CSV file published by the United States Department of Health. The data source contains columns for Year, 113 Cause Name, Cause Name, State, Deaths, and Age-adjusted Death Rate. The data source has 10,689 rows of data, so it is a very sufficient source of information. We also had to bring in data sources for United States population in order to complement our data.We also incorporated a population dataset that included metrics for each state, as well as the United States. The source was entered as a CSV file, where we trimmed the data down into a dataframe that includes “State” and “Population”. This dataset helped us visualize many of the major causes of death per capita, improving the scope and understanding of what the numbers mean. The per capita visualizations help compare states despite their vast differences in population, contributing greatly to the overall story we want to tell. We also included a small dataset regarding inactivity numbers for each state to  see if there was a correlation between exercise and better health.</p>

         <h2>Data Journey</h2>
         <p> Our collaborative data journey commenced with the acquisition of a mortality dataset, which we accessed from an online source using the CDC's data portal. Working together, we leveraged the pandas library in Python to handle and analyze the data effectively. By defining the URL to the CSV file and using the pd.read_csv() function, we loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, named df, for further exploration.In an effort to streamline our analysis, we collaboratively selected specific columns of interest from the DataFrame. The chosen columns, including "Year," "Cause Name," "State," "Deaths," and "Age-adjusted Death Rate," were stored in a new DataFrame called death_df. This refined dataset provided us with a focused view, allowing us to investigate mortality patterns more effectively. Our exploration involved displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame using print(death_df.head()). This helped us gain an initial understanding of the structure and content of the dataset. Further, we jointly displayed the entire DataFrame using print(death_df), enabling a comprehensive overview of the mortality data. In summary, our collaborative efforts involved accessing, loading, and refining a mortality dataset using Python and Pandas. This prepared us for subsequent steps in our data journey, such as exploration, analysis, and visualization of mortality patterns. We also incorporated data from the US Census Bureau that displayed population data for each state from 2017. We created a dataframe with this data using “State” and “Population” as the column titles. States appeared in alphabetical order when printing the dataframe, “df”. This data was merged with the original data from the CDC and became “merged_df”. </p>

         <h2>Data Caveats</h2>
         <p>Overall, we did not have many caveats with our data. Our data source was very detailed but thankfully did not have any missing or inaccurate cells. One specific issue we had with our data was that we needed to create a new dictionary for state abbreviations in order for our choropleth visualizations to show colors. Additional caveats included the need to rename columns in the population data in order to merge it with our original data. Initially, we encountered many problems with the combination of the two data sets as we tried to create visualizations that incorporated both. In the inactivity dataset, we needed to manually input data for certain states that had blank cells.</p>

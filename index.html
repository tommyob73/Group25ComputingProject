         <h2>Project ID Number: 25</h2>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Project Topic: U.S. Leading Causes of Death</h2>
         <p>This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States, beginning in 1999 to 2017. The data is based on information from all resident deaths. This data also analyzes the information at the state level. This is interesting since you can learn the trends of diseases and causes of death and compare state by state and across the U.S. over time. </p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Exploration Questions</h2>
         <p>Here are the main exploration questions that guided our thought process and our visualization creation: <br>
         Question 1: How many deaths were there in each state from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 2: What was the leading cause of death in each state in 2017?  <br />
         Question 3: What was the leading cause of death in the USA as a whole in 2017 (most recent data)?  <br />
         Question 4: How many people died from “accidents” from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 5: What trends exist for cancer deaths from 1999-2017?  <br />
         Question 6: Are certain states more at risk for certain death causes?  <br />
         Question 7: Is there a certain cause of death in the U.S. that is rising rapidly and needs to be controlled?  <br />
         Question 8: Which states have the least number of deaths relative to population in the state?  <br />
         Question 9: Which state has the highest/lowest number of Alzheimer’s Disease?  <br />
         Question 10: Do states that are more highly populated have a greater percentage of deaths from Influenza?  <br />
         Question 11: What is the average number of people killed by heart disease in New York from 2010 to 2017?  <br />
         Question 12: Which cause of death has the highest age-adjusted death rate in Nevada?  <br />
         Question 13: When factoring in population, which states have the highest and lowest death rates per capita?  <br />
         Question 14: What are the underlying factors that cause certain states to have higher death rates per capita, such as age demographics, healthcare spending, and inactivity presences?  <br />
         Question 15: Is there a correlation between these underlying factors and the death rates across states?  <br />
         </p>

         <h2>Data Sources</h2>
         <p>The data source is a CSV file published by the United States Department of Health. The data source contains columns for Year, 113 Cause Name, Cause Name, State, Deaths, and Age-adjusted Death Rate. The data source has 10,689 rows of data, so it is a very sufficient source of information. We also had to bring in data sources for United States population in order to complement our data.</p>
         <div class='my-5'></div>
         <h2>Data Journey</h2>
         <p> Our collaborative data journey commenced with the acquisition of a mortality dataset, which we accessed from an online source using the CDC's data portal. Working together, we leveraged the pandas library in Python to handle and analyze the data effectively. By defining the URL to the CSV file and using the pd.read_csv() function, we loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, named df, for further exploration.In an effort to streamline our analysis, we collaboratively selected specific columns of interest from the DataFrame. The chosen columns, including "Year," "Cause Name," "State," "Deaths," and "Age-adjusted Death Rate," were stored in a new DataFrame called death_df. This refined dataset provided us with a focused view, allowing us to investigate mortality patterns more effectively. Our exploration involved displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame using print(death_df.head()). This helped us gain an initial understanding of the structure and content of the dataset. Further, we jointly displayed the entire DataFrame using print(death_df), enabling a comprehensive overview of the mortality data. In summary, our collaborative efforts involved accessing, loading, and refining a mortality dataset using Python and Pandas. This prepared us for subsequent steps in our data journey, such as exploration, analysis, and visualization of mortality patterns.</p>

         <h2>Data Caveats</h2>
         <p>Overall, we did not have many caveats with our data. Our data source was very detailed but thankfully did not have any missing or inaccurate cells. One specific issue we had with our data was that we needed to create a new dictionary for state abbreviations in order for our choropleth visualizations to show colors.</p>

         <h2>Visualizations/Insights</h2>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>Here are our embedded visualizations and our insights for each visualization:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col"><iframe src="total_pop_choropleth.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         </div>
         <p> This visualization shows how California, Texas, and New York have the highest population out of all states. You can see that the states in Mountain West have the least population. This population graph shows how states along the water tend to have higher populations on average.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="all_causes_choropleth.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> We can see that West Virginia stands out as the state with the highest death rate from all causes per capita. We can see that Utah stands out as the state with the lowest death rate from all causes per capita. We can see that southern states seem to have a higher death rate from all causes per capita compared to western states.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="total_alz_bar.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> You can see that Colorado, California, and Texas have the highest total deaths from Alzheimer's disease in 2017. You can see that Alaska, District of Colombia, and Wyyoming had the lowest number of total deaths from Alzheimer's disease. The total number of deaths are strongly correlated to the population of each state, which makes it hard to analyze.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="leading_cause_bar.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> You can see that only heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of deaths across each state in 2017. For some states, heart disease is the leading cause of death in 2017 and for other states, cancer is the leading cause of death in 2017. There are more states with heart disease as the leading cause of than states with cancer as the leading cause of death.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="leading_breakdown_bar-2.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> You can see that heart disease and cancer make up approximately 50% of death causes across every state. Suicide and kidnney disease are the smallest two out of the top 10 leading causes of death. Every state has a fairly similar proportion between all leading causes of death.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="leading_top10_bar.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> All top 10 states have a fairly similar proportion between all ten leading causes of states. There are not many glaring insights from this graph since the states with the larger bars are just states that have a larger population. We learned that we must factor in the population of every state in order to find more insightful conclusions.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="leading_midwest_bar-2.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> Indiana seems to follow a similar proportion of leading causes of death as other states in the Midwest. All states in the Midwest seem to follow a similar proportion of leading causes of death, when taking into account population differences. Ohio has the most total number of deaths in 2017 out of all states in the Midwest.</p>
         <div class='my-2'><iframe src="leading_northeast_bar-2.html" width="1100" height="500"></iframe></div>
         <p> New York seems to follow a similar proportion of leading causes of death as other states in the Northeast. All states in the Northeast seem to follow a similar proportion of leading causes of death, when taking into account population differences. New York has the most total number of deaths in 2017 out of all states in the Northeast. Vermont has the least total number of deaths in 2017 out of all states in the Northeast.</p>
         <div class="col"><img src=total_deaths_99-17.png class="img-fluid mr-auto d-block border-0 rounded-0"></div>
         <p> Starting in 2004, the total deaths from cancer in the United States has outpaced the annual percentage rise in U.S. population. From 2015 to 2017, the annual rate of total deaths by cancer and population across the United States has grown at the same rate. From 1999 to 2004, the total number of deaths from cancer remained relatively flat.</p>
